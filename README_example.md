Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Credits
List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.
If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.
If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.
## License
The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
## How to Contribute
If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
## Tests
Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
